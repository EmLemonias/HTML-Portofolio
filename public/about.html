<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi!I am Manos and I have a passion for programming.</p>

<p>I started working in 2010 and in the meantime I haven't stopped learning new things <br />
  and trying to better myshelf  with new skills and knowledge of how this world works!
</p>

<p>In the last year, I have dedicated myself to learning programming (Python, Js, C#, HTML..), <br />
  to reach my goal to  become a web Developer! The journey maybe long and hard, but this is <br />
  exactly why every journey is worth it! </p>
